Past Projects
=============
* [**Ninja Scraper**](https://github.com/kqdtran/ninjascraper) - A scraper that automatically downloaded all past exams for a selected course at Berkeley. It literally saved my butt while studying for final exams in Fall 2012, haha. It's a shame that Ninja Course has removed all of their exam database...

* [**3D Ping Pong**](./games/pong.html) - Following a [tutorial](http://buildnewgames.com/webgl-threejs/), I made my own clone for Ping Pong in 3D. It's freaking cool, and I look forward to learning about 3D games more. But I probably should [review Linear Algebra](https://github.com/kqdtran/matrix) first, hah @_@. 

* [**Twitter Sentiment Analysis**](https://github.com/kqdtran/twitter_sentiment_analysis) - Pull live tweets and save them to a text file, then performing sentiment analysis on them to determine the most popular hashtags, the happiest US state, etc. My next steps in this project are to use the TwitterStreaming API to pull tweets live without any local storage whatsoever, and use the data for some graphical visualizations.     

* [**Snake**](./games/snake.html) - Made it when I taught myself some basic Javascript during Spring Break 2013. 

* [**Plagis**](https://github.com/kqdtran/plagis) - A simple plagiarism detector that checked for similarity among homework submissions in an [Introductory Programming class](http://tomrebold.com/csis10a/index.htm), powered under-the-hood by the Edit Distance algorithm. Advised by [Professor Tom Rebold](http://tomrebold.com).

* [**Database Design Project**](http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~ieor115/labs/DP-sp2013/6.pdf) - Relational database management system for [Project Juice](http://www.projectjuice.com/), a San Francisco-based startup. [Here's our web presentation slides](./course/ieor115/slide.html). This is my first team project ever, and it was a memorable experience.

Check out my [Github page](https://github.com/kqdtran) for most of the projects I've been working on. I also spend a lot of my free time taking MOOCs, and you can find some of them also on Github!
