The last third of my internship kicked in last week, and we switched over to the Patent Ratings system, where my mentor and I want to apply NLP/ML techniques like [semantic analysis](http://lsa.colorado.edu/whatis.html) to improve the system. I decided to choose Python's NLTK over Weka, and began to experiment with what NLTK has to offer. As I go, I forked a repo from a fellow student on Github, and began adding notes to it. Hope this will be useful to some people!

Most of the notes come from the [free, online NLP/NLTK book](http://nltk.org/book/). I also use the video lectures/notes from [Stanford's](https://www.coursera.org/course/nlp) and [Columbia's](https://www.coursera.org/course/nlangp) online NLP classes. 

[The notes are available on Github](https://github.com/kqdtran/nltk-cheatsheet). Contributions/corrections are always welcomed :-).
