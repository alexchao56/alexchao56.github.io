Following a [tutorial](http://buildnewgames.com/webgl-threejs/), I made my own clone for 3D Ping Pong. This whole technology is... freaking awesome @_@. Discussions can be found on [r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1j5kem/creating_a_3d_game_with_threejs_and_webgl/).   

[The game can be found here](/games/pong.html). Have fun!
