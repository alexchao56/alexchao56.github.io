{% include JB/setup %}

* I'm an international student from Vietnam who started here three years ago. I spent my first two years of college at [Monterey Peninsula College](http://www.mpc.edu/Pages/default.aspx), graduated with two AA degrees in Math and CS, and transferred to [Cal](http://www.calbears.com/) in Fall 2012. Go Bears!

* Some of my favorite bookmarks: [Study Hacks](http://calnewport.com/blog/), [Life Hacks](http://www.marcandangel.com/), [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/), [r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming), etc. Though I'm trying to limit all this time on the Internet by signing up for weekly newsletter instead &gt;.&gt;   

* I've been playing and practicing tennis for seven years, but I've never played competitively... That said, ping me if you want to hit - I won't disappoint you ;)      

* I'm a really big fan of MOOC. Free MOOCs are just the best way possible to get my feet wet in some other subjects not taught in school...     

* I also watch a lot of English soccer! I'm super thrilled about the World Cup held in Brazil in Summer 2014, and I would loveeee to be there. Would be a dream come true!    

* My favorite games are: Pokemon (X/Y is the best!), Megaman, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Fifa, God of War, Tomb Raider.   

* I wanna be the very best. Like no one ever was. To code 'em is my real test. To debug 'em is my cause.    
I will travel across the land. Learning everyday. Each piece of code to understand. The power that's inside.   
     
Feel free to sing the rest. I usually do that awkwardly in the shower. ;-)
